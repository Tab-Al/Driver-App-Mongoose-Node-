# Driver-App-Mongoose-Node
Creating a simplified version of the Driver-side backend for an Uber/Lyft like application

Back-end has been implemented

1. Create a Driver 
(POST Request is getting handled, no form yet, request has to be sent explicitly (I used Postman))

2. Remove a Driver 
(DELETE Request getting handled, request has to be sent explicitly with the id. No UI yet)

3. Edit a Driver (go offline/online) 
(same, no UI yet, explicit request must be sent)

4. Finding drivers nearby 
(current location explicitly sent, finds drivers within 200km range)
